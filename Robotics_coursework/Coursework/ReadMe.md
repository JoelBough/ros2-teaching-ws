This simulation works in complexity level 1, removing both the colour blocks off the wall. 
I ran it with ros2 launch uol_tidybot tidybot.launch.py and manually deleted the strips.
once done, i randomly put in the blocks, ro2 run uol_tidybot generate_objects and deleted one to make 10.
then it can be run straight from the command window.
